# Submission Guidelines

> Please note: This guidance does not replace any specific guidance you have been given during the recruitment process.

So, you've been asked to complete a Kata as part of your application process? What's that all about?!

We use a technical challenge as part of the recruitment process to give you the opportunity to demonstrate your skills and ability. We review the submissions to decide if we will proceed to the next stage of the process - usually a face to face interview. In the face to face interview we review your code with you, either as a discussion exercise, or often as a pairing exercise where we will ask you to extend your code with additional requirements.

When submitting your kata we are specifically looking for:
- Test driven development (TDD)
- Small "baby" steps
- Frequent commits to a repositiory on Github (so we can see _how_ you got to the solution, considering the first 2 points above)
- A README.md if your solution has any specific setup instructions

Don't spend too long on providing your solution - we find a couple of hours is usually suffice.
