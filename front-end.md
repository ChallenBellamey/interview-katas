# The LateRooms Group front-end task

> It is recommended you review the [submission guidelines](SUBMISSION-GUIDELINES.md) before starting the exercise.

Please take a couple of hours at most to tackle this task. Don't rush to 'finish' the task; that isn't really the overall aim, instead focus on demonstrating what you would consider good front-end practice. Your solution will be the basis for a discussion during our interview.

## The task

Given the following JSON format (feel free to add more data if you wish)...

```json
[
  {
    "name": "hotelone",
    "starRating": 5,
    "facilities": ["car park", "pool"]
  },
  {
    "name": "hoteltwo",
    "starRating": 3,
    "facilities": ["car park", "gym"]
  },
  {
    "name": "hotelthree",
    "starRating": 3,
    "facilities": []
  }
]
```

1. Display the data on a web page in a format you think would be suitable for a simple search results screen.
2. Provide a 'filter' which will help the user reduce the list to only hotels with the relevant facilities.
3. Provide a sort option which will allow a user to order the list on star rating, both descending and ascending.

We would like any JavaScript to be test driven (in whatever library and test framework you feel comfortable with).

Please use React, Redux and any associated libraries you wish to in completing this task. Presentation is less important than functionality for this, but feel free to embellish your solution with whatever lovely CSS3, responsiveness, and HTML5 you wish to show off with.
