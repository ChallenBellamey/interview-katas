# LateRooms Data Science Task

> It is recommended you review the [submission guidelines](SUBMISSION-GUIDELINES.md) before starting the exercise.

Please take a couple of hours at most to tackle this task. Don't rush to 'finish' the task; that isn't really the overall aim, instead focus on demonstrating what you would consider good data science practice. Your solution, and the decisions you make will be the basis for a discussion during our interview.

## The Task

Given the data in hotel_engagement.csv.tar.gz:

- How do LateRooms visitors use the our site?

- What insights can LateRooms act on?

We are aware that this could be a very time intensive project; however we are only expecting a couple of hours of work.
